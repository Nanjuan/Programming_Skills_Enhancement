# Programming_Skills_Enhancement

The code here is a simple app I am building for coding practice. 

The app is a simple Task app where I will see the task that is store on SQLite and used python and NodeJS to display the content on the browser. 

On the folder, Node-App is the main NodeJS app that queries data from the SQLite, and you can create new entries and delete ones. 

I create a simple app on the python-app folder that takes an excel file and import the data to an SQLite database. 

In the folder, Rest-API, I created a NodeJS API app that query modifies and deletes data from the SQLite database created on the python-app. I also created an API call that used users' input from the URL and executed a python script with those calls.
